# Implementation-of-Logistic-Regression-Using-Gradient-Descent

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the the Logistic Regression Using Gradient Descent.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1.Import the required packages and print the present data.
2.Print the placement data and salary data.
3.Find the null and duplicate values.
4.Using logistic regression find the predicted values of accuracy , confusion matrices.
5.Finally execute the program and display the output.

## Program:
```
/*

Developed by: 
RegisterNumber:  
*/
```

## Output:
![logistic regression using gradient descent](sam.png)


## Result:
Thus the program to implement the the Logistic Regression Using Gradient Descent is written and verified using python programming.
